# Enrolment Dashboard
This repo contains the code for my prototype of a Course Enrolment Dashboard using R, Shiny Server, and Slidify.

You can view the Course Enrolment Dashboard at http://eolaguer.shinyapps.io/enrollment. Additional documentation can be found there.

A short online presentation introducing the Dashboard can be viewed at http://eolaguer.github.io/enrollment. 

Thanks to the instructors of the Data Science courses in Coursera for teaching me the basics of R. Thanks to RStudio, Github, Ramnath Vaidyanathan for creating these amazing free and open source tools and services!
